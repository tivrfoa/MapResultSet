|| handle columns with same name, but from different tables ...
    I'll handle it later. For now the user use an alias.
    FIXME It needs to pass the qualifier together with the label, eg: p.name instead of just name
```
select p.name, c.name, c.phone_code as PhoneCode
            from person as p join country as c on
              p.country_id = c.id
```
|| alias might not a simple word
