## MapResultSet Query Restrictions

MapResultSet has some restrictions regarding your queries.
These restrictions could be handled, but I think they make
your query more readable too. xD

1. Join must be done using JOIN, not in WHERE clause;
2. Values returned from SELECT that are not a simple column name must
   have an alias and be preceded with `AS`, eg: select 1 as one; select age + 18 as something;
3. Columns in `select` must be preceded by the table name if the `from` clause contains
more than one table;
4. The clauses must be in this order: select, from, [where], [group by], [having], [order by]
5. The variable annotated with `@Query` must be final, eg:
```java
@Query
final String listPeople;
```

Current *known* limitations (ps: please open an issue if you find others =))
 - it doesn't handle 'USING' in joins. MySQL only?
